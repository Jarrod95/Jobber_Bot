# Jobber_Bot
A bot to extract data from structured .docx and .pdf files and input it into our CRM via Selenium

As the CRM my job uses to coordinate work for contractors around Australia is lacking the functionality to make the administrative workload simpler and easier, I have been working on creating a python program that can reduce the extensive data entry required to set up a new client. 

For the foreseeable future, a Python program to automate this data entry process will allow the company to take on more clients, focus more on providing a better service to exisiting clients, and even allow us to put energy into marketing to attract more clients. 

It currently takes up to 15 minutes, and sometimes longer, to input all the data contained in our Service Request documents into our CRM Jobber. Jobber currently does not have an API, hence the need to use Selenium. 

Below is the taks required for the program to reduce our current workload:
